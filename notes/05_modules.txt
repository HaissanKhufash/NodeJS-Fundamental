Get this concept is essential, because depending of our neededs a module might exist to aid us,
that's why we must familiarize with these ones and learn about them in a depth way.

1. Export yours:
    Supposing that we've a file named as 'file.js', we're gonna export a slice of our code,
    this might be a literal, a function or an object...
    i.e. 
    2. IMPORT from node core of this way ===> const util = require('util'),
    MY_OBJECT = {
        name: 'Name',
        surname: 'Surname',
        info: function(){
            console.log(util.format('Hi %s, %s. Nice to meet you', this.surname, this.name))
        }
    }

    module.exports = MY_OBJECT

3. Import yours:
    Keeping on with the above example, we're gonna call the file in another one named as 'importing.js'
    to use the object exported by us previously.
    i.e.
    const greeting = require('file')
    file.info()

    /c://Users/Desktop/Node_course> node importing.js
    Result: Hi Surname, Name. Nice to meet you
