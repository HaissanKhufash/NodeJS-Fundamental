Use directories is a continual practice that we do in our Operating System, manipulate them may be an 
exceptional way to control our actions with them.

1. Create a directory:
    fs.mkdir(<path>[, <options>], <callback>) where path is the directory to create. Options may have
    recursive which default value is 'false', if this one is true, the first directory path created,
    can still be undefined when recursive is true, if no directory was created. And Mode, which
    default value is '0o777'.
    
    i.e.
    const fs = require('fs')
    fs.mkdir('my_new_directory', carryCreatingOut)
