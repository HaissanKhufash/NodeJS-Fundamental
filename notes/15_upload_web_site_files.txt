- In our server we're gonna validate the URLs, if req.url is equal to home ('/') then, we read the index.html and,
we write with the end() method the data inside of the document.
- After that we're gonna validate possible type of files required in our document and, create a readable passing by
arguments an absolute path with the req.url defined at the end, some like this: 
==================>let readable = fs.createReadStream(path.join('../public', 'assets', req.url))<==================
- We must use the response to write the head in our server again, but this time with the content type of the file
validated before, example: res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type' : 'text/css'})
THERE ARE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT 'CONTENT-TYPE' HERE => https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-headers-content-type/
- At the end of the validation, we use the readable to append information to the response with the pipe() method,
this one has the end() method as true by default, that's why we don't use res.end(), instead of that we use:
===============================>readable.pipe(res)<===============================
