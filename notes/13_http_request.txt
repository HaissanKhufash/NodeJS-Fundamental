We carry a request on HTTP out with the ClientRequest object -created at the time of using the line:
http.request(<options>), this one receives an object with 'options' which must have a hostname, port, path,
and method.

i.e.
const http = require('http'),
options = {host: 'localhost', port: '5500', path: '/league'},
req = http.request(options)

We get information about the response when we specify determined instructions in the 'response' event belonging to
the request.
i.e.
req.on('response', res => {
    res.on('data', chunk => {
        console.log(chunk.toString())
    })
})
In the above example, we print on the console the data received from the response

After use any request, we must close it with req.end([<data>[, <encoding>]][, <callback>])
