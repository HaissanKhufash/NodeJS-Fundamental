Node is executed through a process of an asynchronous way, that's why we can manipulate arguments
of the process when we just compile the file.

- Get all arguments of the process:
    process.argv -array- ===> this property returns all arguments of the process, if we don't assign more
    arguments, the stored values are [<node source>, <file path>]
    <node source> ===> path where node is installed.
    <file path> ===> path where we're compiling the file.


- Assign arguments to the process:
    i.e. /c://Users/Desktop/Node_course> node file.js --<arg1> <value1> --<arg2> <value2>... --<argN> <valueN>
    * Arguments in JS must be written as they were specified at time of compiling the file.

                                PROCESS IS A GLOBAL VARIABLE...
