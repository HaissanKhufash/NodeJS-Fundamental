- Get the current path (where we're compiling the file):
    __dirname -String- ===> global variable JS available when we're compiling a file with node.

- Get the current path & the filename (where we're compiling the file including this one):
    __filename -String- ===> global variable JS available when we're compiling a file with node.

- Require a module.
    i.e. let module = require('module')

- Get the basename of the current file:
    example:
    let path = require('path'),
    thisFilename = path.basename(__filename)
