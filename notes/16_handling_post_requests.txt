- In our server we validate which is the method of the request either GET or POST, if GET then we write the content
of our supposed form from an HTML file and with the pipe method we're gonna append information bit by bit.
Some like this: 
i.e.
res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type' : 'text/html'})
fs.createReadStream('../form/form.html', 'UTF-8').pipe(res)
- If POST then we store chunks of the request when there's any data; when stored process is done we're gonna
end our server page 'overwriting' the last content with the form data.
i.e.
let body = ''
req.on('data', chunk => body += chunk)
req.on('end', () => {
    res.end(`
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <title>Form HTML</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Data has just been send</h1>
            <p>${body}</p>
        </body>
        </html>
    `)
})
