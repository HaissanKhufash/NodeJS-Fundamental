1. Install express in our project.
2. Create a public folder in which we store all documents that make alive our page.
3. In public's assets we create a JSON file and suppose that this one is a API REST.
4. At the same level of public folder we create our app which manage our server:
    - Main page:
        1. Charge index.html as main page or root page ('/') 
    - get ===> '/get-films':
        1. Get JSON file and read it of a synchronous way.
        2. Send its content in format 'application/json'.
    - post ===> '/new':
        1. Obtain require variables with req.body.
        2. Save JSON file in a variable.
        3. Parse JSON file to an object.
        4. Push in 'films' array belonging to the JSON object created previously an object
        with the obtained require variables.
        5. Write in the JSON file the stringified object of a synchronous way.
        6. Send whether messages.
5. Use AJAX to get the content from the JSON file.
6. Use AJAX to post the form on '/new' and reload automatically the page.
