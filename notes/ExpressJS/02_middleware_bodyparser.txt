This module is made to manage information like obtained parameters from an url -it's not the only utility, 
this one has some interesting properties when we define it as a middleware in the application.
i.e.
const express = require('express'),
app = express(),
urlencoded = require('body-parser').urlencoded({extended: false}), ===> specify that we wanna use  URL's information
PORT = 3000

app.use(urlencoded) ===> define as middleware

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    const name = req.query.name, ==== ALLOW US TO WORK WITH
    surname = req.query.surname  ==== QUERIES FROM AN URL AND, SO...

    res.send(`<p>Name: ${name}</p>
              <p>Surname: ${surname}</p>`)
})

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server has been initialized... port: ${PORT}`))
