* If we want to use pug with ExpressJS, we must create a folder in our project named as "views", and there add
a pug file.
1. We must install the pug module ===> npm --save-dev install pug. The most of the time we use pug as a development
dependecy.
2. Our app.js or server handling file should be at the same level than "views" folder.
3. In the app.js file we must set pug as the view engine to use ===> app.set('view engine', 'pug').
4. Render the template engine file on a route:
    i.e.
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.render(<pug file name>-String-, <options>-Object)
    })
    In <options> we can set some values to use in the pug file such as information from our application.
